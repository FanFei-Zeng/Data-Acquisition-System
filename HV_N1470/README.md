This section include three parts: IN , OUT and USB connectors. The module permits **RS485** and **RS232** port. In this page, **RS232** is used only. 

As is shown in Fig.1, three-pin cable for **RS232** connector is needed, where **RX** represents "Receive(rx) Data", **TX** for "Transmit(tx) Data" and **GND** for "ground".
